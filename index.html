    <h1>Welcome to Stock Analysis</h1>
    <p>Stock analysis is the evaluation of a particular trading instrument, an investment sector, or the market as a whole. Stock analysts attempt to determine the future activity of an instrument, sector, or market. There are two basic types of stock analysis: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.</p>
    <p>Fundamental analysis involves analyzing a company's financial statements to determine its fair value. This includes examining factors such as earnings, revenue, assets, and liabilities. Technical analysis, on the other hand, involves analyzing past market data, primarily price and volume, to predict future price movements.</p>
    <p>Whether you're a beginner investor or a seasoned trader, understanding stock analysis is essential for making informed investment decisions. By analyzing stocks, you can identify potential opportunities, assess risks, and optimize your investment portfolio.</p>
